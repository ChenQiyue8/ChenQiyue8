## About
Self-motivated Fourth-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Washington with a deep passion for technology and its potential to improve lives. My areas of expertise encompass Embedded Systems, IoT, and edge device machine learning. I believe that engineering serves as a powerful tool to make a meaningful impact on society.

Undertaken several Arduino projects related to IoT and smart homes. Recently trying out a way to integrate and manage industry-level mechatronics into the AWS IoT cloud, with a particular focus on smart agriculture.

Besides technical skills, I deeply value interpersonal connections, and I like to engage in thoughtful conversations to gain insights into the thought processes and motivations of others, being a listening ear enables me to provide tailored support and meet their individual needs.

## Hobbies:
Playing board games, Tennis, Having insightful conversations with different people, Cool arduino project, Shenzheng I/O (pc game)


## Soulcare:
Reading a philosophical book alone on a warm, sunny afternoon with smooth Jazz
